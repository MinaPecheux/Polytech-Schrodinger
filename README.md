# [MAIN3] Projet Schrödinger
This project was realized between January and June 2017 by Anida Khizar, Rahmatoulaye Ndiaye, Vincent Nicol and Mina Pêcheux.

The study was divided in several parts:
1) a 1-D box, with different potentials and a time-independent solution
2) a 2-D box, with different potentials and a time-independent solution
3) a 1-D box, with different potentials and a time-dependent solution
